<h2>MODEL "S" CARBURETER</h2>

<h3>Used on Series 691 Nash Sixes</h3>


<p>The carbureter measures the fuel charges for the engine and
automatically mixes them with the proper amount of air to form a highly
combustible gas. The Marvel Model "S" Carbureter is of the automatic air
valve, heat controlled type. Its outstanding advantages are:</p>

<p>1. Simplicity of construction and operation.</p>

<p>2. Quick starting in any weather.</p>

<p>3. Automatically controlled heat application to ensure complete
vaporization of fuels.</p>

<p>4. Economy in fuel consumption.</p>

<p>5. Ease of adjustment to meet varied driving and climatic conditions.</p>


<h4>CONSTRUCTION</h4>

<p>The construction embodies a main body or mixing chamber and a
conventional float chamber bowl with fuel strainer attached at point of
entrance of fuel to bowl. Within the mixing chamber are two nozzles
which proportion the amount of gasoline used in the mixture. One of
these nozzles, called the "low speed," is regulated by the gasoline
adjustment screw at bottom of carbureter and the other, called the "high
speed," is controlled by the automatic air valve. An air screw is
provided which regulates the pressure of the air valve spring enclosed
therein. Within this screw is also enclosed a plunger connected by a
link to the air valve. The function of this plunger is to provide a
resistance in addition to that of the air valve spring to assist in
acceleration. This arrangement of plunger and air valve screw is termed
the dash pot.</p>

<p>A further control of the high speed jet is provided by the fuel metering
valve operated by the carbureter throttle. This valve provides the
maximum fuel feed to the "high speed" nozzle when the throttle is fully
opened for high speeds and for quick "pick up." During the ordinary
driving ranges this valve controls the amount of fuel being used, thus
providing all the economy possible. This valve is entirely automatic and
requires no adjustment.</p>

<p>The passage-way from the mixing chamber to the intake manifold is
controlled by a butterfly valve which is called the throttle-valve and
is connected to the throttle-lever on the steering wheel as well as to
the foot accelerator, its position determining the amount of gas and air
or mixture being fed the engine.</p>


<h4>STARTING</h4>

<p>A choke button is provided on the instrument board to assist in
starting. Pulling out this button closes a butterfly choker valve (see
cut) in the air intake passage of carbureter which restricts the air
opening of the carbureter, and consequently produces a richer mixture.</p>

<p>To start engine, pull out choke button all the way. Advance spark lever
about half way and throttle lever about one-quarter way and depress
starter pedal.</p>

<p>As soon as motor fires when starting, this control should be released
part way, otherwise too much fuel will be drawn from carbureter, causing
flooding of the motor and failure of the latter to continue to promptly
fire. After starting, motor should be allowed to run "part choke" as
stated for a few minutes while warming up, then the choker control
should be fully released, or pushed in completely on the instrument
board, and engine allowed to run normally for sometime until water in
cylinder jackets is thoroughly warmed up before starting to make final
carbureter adjustments.</p>


<h4>HEAT CONTROL&mdash;STOVE</h4>

<p>In the colder seasons warm air is fed to air intake of carbureter
through the warm air elbow "F" (see cut). This elbow connects the
carbureter with the warm air stove, which is a casting surrounding the
two exhaust heat tubes which supply exhaust heat to the carbureter
jackets as described below.</p>

<p>The amount of heat required for proper carburation depends on the
temperature of the outside air. The first means of control is in the
warm air stove just described, which should be connected to the
carbureter furnishing warm air to carbureter air intake in all seasons
of the year when the outside air temperature is below 50&deg; F., whenever
the outside air temperature runs above this point cold air should be
furnished to carbureter air intake. This can be done by loosening the
wing nut holding the warm air elbow "F" on the stove and also loosening
the set screw holding this elbow in the air intake of carbureter, after
which slide elbow out of air intake and revolve it&mdash;180 degrees about an
horizontal axis and re-insert in carbureter air intake and lock in place
with set screw. The opening in the elbow now is turned down away from
the stove and draws in only cold air.</p>

<p>The above procedure, it must be understood, will vary somewhat due to
differences in locality, altitude and fuels used, but it should be borne
in mind that the best economy can be had with cold air passing to the
carbureter, and the stove should not be connected until the acceleration
and performance of the job requires the use of warm air for the best
results.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the carbureter should be made per the above
description of the stove, as the latter is used for meeting weather
conditions and should be set as described.</p>


<h4>HEAT CONTROL&mdash;CARBURETER JACKETS</h4>

<p>The carbureter and manifolds have been designed to utilize the exhaust
gases of the engine to insure complete vaporization and a consequent
minimum consumption of fuel. This is accomplished by surrounding the
upper portion of the mixing chamber with a large heat jacket provided
with an inlet and an outlet opening and connected by means of tubes to
an exhaust manifold valve body in the exhaust pipe of the engine; this
valve body, housing a large valve called the main-exhaust-heat-valve
("C" in cut) within the body itself, the return or outlet tube from the
carbureter heat jacket entering the valve-body in the lower portion
below the main-exhaust-heat-valve.</p>

<p>The main-exhaust-heat-valve "C" is connected by means of a lever and
long connecting rod to the throttle lever of the carbureter so that when
the throttle valve is operated the main-exhaust-valve is operated
simultaneously with it.</p>

<p>The purpose of the carbureter heat jacket and valve in exhaust line with
connections described, is to provide means for utilizing the heat of the
exhaust gases of the motor for vaporization of the fuel supplied the
engine by the carbureter and to do so automatically. The automatic
feature of same is accomplished by setting the Main-Exhaust-Heat-Valve
"C" by means of the long connecting rod, in closed position with the
closed or idling position of the throttle valve, thus providing for and
causing all of the exhaust gases of the engine to pass through the heat
jacket of the carbureter when engine is idling and to regulate the
volume of this heat as throttle is opened by automatically opening the
Main-Exhaust-Heat-Valve, thus allowing the increasing volume of the
exhaust gases to pass on out through the main exhaust pipe without being
deflected and by-passed to the carbureter heat-jacket as the motor speed
increases.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/image1a.jpg">
<img src="images/image1.jpg" width="600" height="355" alt="HEAT SETTING No. 1" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">HEAT SETTING No. 1</span>
</div>

<p>By referring to the cut shown (See Page 5) and noting "Heat Setting No.
1," it will be noted that valve "C" in main exhaust line is fully closed
with the closed or idling position of the throttle valve. This
adjustment is accomplished by having long connecting rod "R" from valve
"C" Lever set in "Hole No. 1," in Throttle Lever "L," being sure that
when throttle valve is standing in fully closed or idling position that
valve "C" is also in closed position, proving out the latter feature by
loosening connection of valve "C" lever holding long connecting rod;
holding Throttle Lever "L" in closed or idling position and bringing up
valve "C" lever on connecting rod "R" as far as it will go to the right
toward the carbureter and tightening its connection on the connecting
rod in that position. After having made the adjustment as just
described, it is assured that "Heat Setting No. 1" has been properly
made and that all of the heat possible from the exhaust has been
secured.</p>

<p>This "Heat Setting No. 1," provides as stated, for the most exhaust heat
obtainable and should be used during the entire year, except in
extremely hot seasons or hot climates or when high-test gasoline is
being used in engine and even then unless engine is losing power due to
excessive heat.</p>

<p><b>If loss of power or mileage due to too much heat is experienced, first
be sure that it is not due to driving on hot-air instead of cold-air.</b>
After making this observation, if there is still too much heat, refer to
cut (See Page 7) describing "Heat Setting No. 2." It will be noted that
connecting rod "R" from valve "C" is removed from "Hole No. 1," in
Throttle Lever "L" and placed in "Hole No. 2," in Throttle Lever. This
change is all that is necessary in order to reduce the amount of heat
applied to carbureter. In "Heat Setting No. 2," when the throttle is in
closed or idling position, valve "C" is quite aways off its seat. This
adjustment provides for a great deal less heat than is provided by "Heat
Setting No. 1" and is all that is required in the reduction of the
volume of heat together with driving on "Cold" air for the
main-air-supply, in the warmest weather or hottest climates.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/image2a.jpg">
<img src="images/image2.jpg" width="600" height="355" alt="HEAT SETTING No. 2" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">HEAT SETTING No. 2</span>
</div>


<p>NOTE&mdash;<b>After original position of valve "C" is made as described in "Heat
Setting No. 1" do not again readjust valve "C" on connecting rod</b> but
when changing from "Heat Setting No. 1" to "Heat Setting No. 2," merely
change position of long connecting rod from "Hole No. 1" to "Hole No. 2"
in throttle lever.</p>


<h4>ADJUSTMENT</h4>

<p>No change should be made in the carbureter adjustments until after an
inspection has been made to determine if the trouble is in some other
unit. It should be noted that the gasoline lines are clear, that there
is gasoline in the vacuum tank, that there are no leaks at connections
between carbureter and engine, that the ignition system is in proper
condition, and that there is even compression in all cylinders.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to test adjustment or to make a readjustment proceed
as follows:</p>

<p>Set air screw so that the end is flush with the end of ratchet set
spring. Loosen packing nut on needle adjustment. Turn gasoline
adjustment to the right very carefully so as not to injure the needle
point, until the valve is closed gently against its seat. Then turn to
left approximately one complete turn which will bring notch in the disc
handle directly below the guide post above it. Tighten packing nut to
hold needle firmly as set.</p>

<p>The notch in disc handle of needle is put in handle after the needle has
been carefully calibrated by a flow-meter at the factory, therefore the
notch in handle should register with guide post above it. This setting
of needle valve <b>is absolutely essential</b> to get the best results. The
object in directing that needle be first turned to the right until
closed is to insure against two or more turns open, as from closed
position to notch (usually about one turn) is the normal setting. This
being true it is not necessary to turn needle in to the right firmly but
merely far enough to be sure that when turning back to the left, to the
notch registering with guide post, that the needle is not more than once
around or one turn from its seat.</p>

<p>Set stove heat and damper heat as previously instructed above. Pull out
choker to closed position and start engine in usual manner. As soon as
engine has fired release choker three-fourths of way in. Run until
engine has warmed up then push choker all the way in, remembering to
never use choker longer than necessary, as <b>when not needed</b> it has a
tendency to foul up engine and ruin the lubricating oil in the crank
case.</p>

<p>Next, set air screw for good idle by either turning to the right a
little or backing out to the left as the needs of the engine require,
remembering that <b>first of all, the needle must be set as described</b>. With
the needle so set and the engine warmed up, the adjustment of the air
screw for proper idling is easily accomplished by using a little care.
If the air screw is turned in too tight, the motor will roll. If the air
screw is not tight enough, the motor will hesitate and perhaps stop
entirely. To make a nice clean adjustment for idle, first having set
needle as described, turn air screw in quarter of a turn at a time until
engine, does roll; then turn back to the left until engine hesitates,
indicating that mixture has too much air and is too lean; next turn air
screw in to the right three or four notches at a time until engine runs
smoothly. This accomplished (and it is very easy to do by proceeding as
directed above) the proper adjustment for the entire range of the engine
will have been attained, thus insuring the best economy and power.</p>

</div>


<p>If the engine idles too fast with throttle closed, the latter may be
adjusted by means of the throttle lever adjusting screw.</p>


<h4>RICH MIXTURE</h4>

<p>An over-rich mixture will cause the engine speed to fluctuate through
more or less regular periods from high to low speeds; the engine will
seem to be mis-firing and there will be noticeable a strong odor, as
well as, usually, a heavy black smoke from the exhaust.</p>


<h4>LEAN MIXTURE</h4>

<p>The best adjustment is obtained with the fuel and air valves set as
described. It must be remembered that too lean a mixture as well as an
over rich mixture causes over-heating and loss of power and is not as
economical as an adjustment which provides just the proper proportion of
gasoline and air.</p>


<p class="t2"><b>CAUTION</b></p>

<p><b>It must be remembered that the low speed needle has been carefully
calibrated to notch in disc handle and guide post above it, at the
factory and that in making an adjustment that the needle must be so set
and the rest of the adjusting done with the air screw as described</b>,
never varying from described needle setting unless in extreme cold
weather, when a little more gas may be carried, or turning off a little
when casing head gas is used in hot weather.</p>

<h4>REPLACEMENT FOR PREVIOUS MODEL NASH SIXES</h4>

<p>The Model "S" Marvel Carbureter is interchangeable with the Model "K"
Marvel Carbureter, which was standard equipment on the 1922 and 1923
Nash Sixes of the early 691 series.</p>

<p>The previous series 681 Nash Sixes of 1921, 1920, and 1919, which were
equipped with the Model "E" Marvel Carbureter as standard equipment, can
be very greatly improved by the installation of the Model "S"
carbureter, exhaust damper body assembly necessary for same, and the hot
air stove assembly that goes with this installation.</p>

<p>Following is the complete Parts Price List of the Model "S" carbureter,
